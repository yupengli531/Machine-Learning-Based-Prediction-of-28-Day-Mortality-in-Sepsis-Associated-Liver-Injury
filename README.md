# Machine Learning-Based Prediction of 28-Day Mortality in Sepsis-Associated Liver Injury (SALI)

**Background:**  
Sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) is a frequent and severe complication of sepsis, significantly increasing mortality risk. Early detection of high-risk patients is essential but challenging due to the nonspecific and complex nature of SALI. This study applies machine learning (ML) models to predict 28-day mortality within the first 24 hours of ICU admission.

**Methods:**  
A total of **1,157 patients** were included (826 from MIMIC-IV, 225 from MIMIC-III, and 106 from eICU). The MIMIC-IV dataset was divided into training and internal validation sets (7:3), while MIMIC-III and eICU were used for external validation. 30 clinically relevant features were selected. Eight ML algorithms‚Äî**Logistic Regression**, **Elastic-Net Logistic Regression (cv-glmnet)**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**, **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**‚Äîwere evaluated using AUROC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and specificity. Model interpretability was enhanced via **SHAP** and **LIME** analyses.

**Results:**  
XGBoost achieved the best overall performance with an **AUROC of 0.8556 (95% CI: 0.807‚Äì0.898)**, **accuracy of 0.7702**, **recall of 0.8469**, and **specificity of 0.7200**.  
Key predictive features identified included **lactate**, **blood urea nitrogen (BUN)**, **heart rate**, **hemoglobin**, and **diastolic blood pressure (DiaBP)**.  
Both SHAP and LIME analyses provided global and patient-level interpretability.

**Conclusion:**  
The proposed XGBoost-based model demonstrates strong predictive capability for early mortality in SALI patients and enhances clinical decision support for ICU management.
